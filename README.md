AHK-updater
===========
Keeps your AutoHotKey-script sorted and simple to update

It is mainly created to be used for AutoHotKey hotstrings with variables, but can possibly be used for more.

The application is using a XML-file for storing the data between sessions. The file is saved in the Debug folder.
There will come a possibility to define where to save the XML- and script-files.
